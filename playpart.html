        <h1>Abhilash acts in a play</h1>
        <h3> The Master Builder by Henrik Ibsen</h3>
        <p style="white-space: pre-wrap;">
            In the draughtsmen's office sit KNUT BROVIK and his son RAGNAR,
  occupied with plans and calculations.  At the desk in the outer
  office stands KAIA FOSLI, writing in the ledger.  KNUT BROVICK
  is a spare old man with white hair and beard.  He wears a
  rather threadbare but well-brushed black coat, with spectacles,
  and a somewhat discoloured white neckcloth.  RAGNAR BROVIK is
  a well-dressed, light-haired man in his thirties, with a
  slight stoop.  KAIA FOSLI is a slightly built girl, a little
  over twenty, carefully dressed, and delicate-looking.  She has
  a green shade over her eyes.--All three go on working for some
  time in silence.


KNUT BROVIK.

[Rises suddenly, as if in distress, from the table; breathes heavily and
laboriously as he comes forward into the doorway.] No, I can't bear it
much longer!

KAIA.

[Going up to him.] You are feeling very ill this evening, are you not,
Uncle?


BROVIK.

Oh, I seem to get worse every day.


RAGNAR.

[Has risen and advances.] You ought to go home, father. Try to get a
little sleep--


BROVIK.

[Impatiently.] Go to bed, I suppose? Would you have me stifled outright?


KAIA.

Then take a little walk.


RAGNAR.

Yes, do. I will come with you.


BROVIK.

[With warmth.] I will not go till he comes! I and determined to have
it out this evening with--[in a tone of suppressed bitterness]--with
him--with the chief.


KAIA.

[Anxiously.] Oh no, uncle,--do wait awhile before doing that!
