       <p> HALVARD SOLNESS comes in through the hall door.  He is a man no
        longer young, but healthy and vigorous, with close-cut curly
        hair, dark moustache and dark thick eyebrows.  He wears a
        greyish-green buttoned jacket with an upstanding collar and
        broad lapels.  On his head he wears a soft grey felt hat,
        and he has one or two light portfolios under his arm.</p>

        <p class="direction">[Near the door, points towards the draughtsmen's office, and asks in a
        whisper:]</p><p> Are they gone?</p>
